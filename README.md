## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).
2. Fill in the required information and press the „Create Account“ button.

## Configuring the Watson Assistant on the IBM Cloud

<h4>1) Create a Watson Assistant Service</h4>
After the login you will see your IBM Cloud Dashboard. In the upper menu bar click Catalog. In the Catalog section, click on the AI category, then select Watson Assistant. On the next page select the Lite Plan - or the Plus Trial - these should cover all deployment options and you can also choose a region, where you would like to deploy your service as well as a service name. Click "Create".

## Configuring the Twilio Account

1. Register for [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and Start a free Trial.
2. Confirm your email.
3. Verify your phone number. Therefore, use the phone number you will use to call the Watson Assistant later on. You will receive a verification code.

4. After the successful registration you can skip the intro and go directly to your dashboard, where you click “Get a trial number”, then click choose this number. It is important that you choose the provided number without trying to change it and save it for the next part.

## Configuring the phone Integration 

Now we need to set up our Watson Assistant phone integration to enable it as a Voice Agent.


Go to your IBM Watson Assistant Dashboard, create a new Assistant, and add the skill you created earlier.

Now click on `Add integration` on the right Side.

![Agent create](readme_images/1_add_integration.png)

Then choose `Phone` and click on `Create`. If haven't already started your 30 day free Plus trial, you will have to start it, because this integration is part of the Plus Trial. 

Add a Name, copy and save the SIP adress, add your Twilio Phone Number and create a `Speech to text` service, as well as a `Text to speech` service.

After you finished the setup, it should look like this.

Go to `Speech to Text` and switch to a language of your choosing.
